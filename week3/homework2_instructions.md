To add checkboxes to all tasks in your project management plan, you can modify the format slightly. Here's how your task list would look with checkboxes:

### Week 1: Graph Class Design and Implementation

**Day 1-2: Research and Design**
- [ ] **Task 1:** Understand the basics of graph theory and familiarize yourself with Dijkstra's algorithm (Resource: Wikipedia, Algorithm textbooks).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Decide on the graph representation (adjacency list vs. matrix) based on density consideration.

**Day 3-4: Graph Class Development**
- [ ] **Task 3:** Write a Graph class with the following member functions:
    - `V(G)`, `E(G)`, `adjacent(G, x, y)`, `neighbors(G, x)`, `add(G, x, y)`, `delete(G, x, y)`, `get_node_value(G, x)`, `set_node_value(G, x, a)`, `get_edge_value(G, x, y)`, `set_edge_value(G, x, y, v)`.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Implement constructors for graph initialization.

**Day 5-6: Random Graph Generation**
- [ ] **Task 5:** Implement a method to generate a random graph given edge density and distance range parameters.
- [ ] **Task 6:** Test graph generation to ensure it adheres to the specifications (edge density and distance range).

**Day 7: Code Review and Documentation**
- [ ] **Task 7:** Review code for style, efficiency, and correctness.
- [ ] **Task 8:** Document the Graph class with appropriate comments and usage instructions.

### Week 2: Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation and Testing

**Day 8-9: Priority Queue and ShortestPath Class Development**
- [ ] **Task 9:** Write a PriorityQueue class with heap functionality.
- [ ] **Task 10:** Begin the ShortestPath class with stub functions.

**Day 10-11: Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- [ ] **Task 11:** Implement Dijkstra's algorithm within the ShortestPath class.
- [ ] **Task 12:** Test Dijkstra's algorithm on a small, known graph to ensure correctness.

**Day 12-13: Integration and Large-scale Testing**
- [ ] **Task 13:** Integrate Dijkstra’s algorithm with the Graph class.
- [ ] **Task 14:** Test on graphs with 50 nodes, 20% and 40% densities for correctness.

**Day 14: Monte Carlo Simulation for Average Path Length**
- [ ] **Task 15:** Implement the Monte Carlo simulation to calculate average shortest path.
- [ ] **Task 16:** Run simulations and collect data for graphs with the specified densities.

### Final Days: Analysis, Write-up, and Submission

**Day 15: Data Analysis**
- [ ] **Task 17:** Analyze the data collected from the Monte Carlo simulations.

**Day 16: Write-up**
- [ ] **Task 18:** Write the 200-word explanation on what was learned during the process.
- [ ] **Task 19:** Prepare the printout of the program and the output showing the average path length calculation.

**Day 17-18: Peer Review and Revisions**
- [ ] **Task 20:** Submit the program for peer grading and review peers' submissions if required.
- [ ] **Task 21:** Incorporate feedback from peer grading into the final submission.

**Final Review and Submission**
- [ ] **Task 22:** Perform a final review of the code and documentation.
- [ ] **Task 23:** Submit the final version of the program, documentation, and written explanation.

**Daily End-of-Day Review:**
- [ ] Evaluate progress.
- [ ] Adjust the plan for the next day as needed.
- [ ] Record any issues or insights to address later.

This format allows you to easily track your progress by checking off each task as you complete it.
